# Install Guide

## Prerequisites:
A Window or Mac PC is required to build and run the project. Unity projects can typically be built for and run on Linux and other platforms, but we do not officially support these platforms due to insufficient testing.
A minimal install of Unity version 2019.2.41f with the build tools for the desired platform is required. This can be installed via Unity Hub, which can be downloaded at https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download. Newer versions of Unity will likely work as well but might have varying results.

## Dependent Libraries:

No libraries are necessary for running a build of the project. For building the project, only the dependencies necessary for the Unity installation are necessary, which will be automatically installed during the Unity installation process.

## Download Instructions:
Create a clone of this GitHub repository or download it as a .zip via the green “clone or download” button.

## Build Instructions:

Open Unity Hub and click “Add” to locate the downloaded project folder, then open it. After the project has been automatically initialized and assets imported, check the Unity console for errors. If there are none, feel free to build the project now. This is accessible from File -> Build Settings, where you can also select the target platform. Click “Build” and you will be able to select a directory in which to build the project.

## Installation:

This project does not require installation.

## Run Instructions:

Double click the executable that was in your build or download folder (e.g. GamesForAssessment.exe on Windows).
